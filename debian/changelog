debathena-locker-support (10.4.1.1-0debathena1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update to 10.4.1.1 (fix bugs in athdir command-line parsing)
  * Install attach and friends in /bin, not /usr/bin
  * Symlink /bin/zinit to true temporarily, for people who actually have
    their own initprogs configuration in zephyr.vars.  We may eventually
    ship a zinit.
  * Symlink nfsid to fsid in case it's still 1993 somewhere
